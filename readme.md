**sublime-swap** is a plug-in for the Sublime Text 2 text editor.  It swaps text selections for logical equivalents, such as:

- *width* becomes *height*

- *left* becomes *right*

- *true* becomes *false*

The plug-in also supports numbers:

- *-20* becomes *20*

- *50* becomes *-50*

And tolerates numbers with CSS values:

- *-15px* becomes *15px*

- *45%* becomes *-45%*
